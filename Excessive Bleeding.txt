=======================> Excessive Bleeding

1. **Ensure Safety:**
   - Prioritize your safety and wear gloves if available to protect yourself from bodily fluids and potential infections.

2. **Apply Direct Pressure:**
   - Immediately apply firm, direct pressure to the wound using a clean cloth, sterile gauze, or a piece of clothing. Press directly on the bleeding site with your hand.

3. **Elevate the Wounded Area:**
   - Elevate the bleeding area above the heart level, if possible, to help reduce blood flow and control bleeding.

4. **Maintain Pressure:**
   - Maintain continuous pressure on the wound, even if blood soaks through the initial dressing. Do not remove the soaked dressing; instead, add more layers and continue applying pressure.

5. **Apply a Tourniquet (if necessary and trained):**
   - Only use a tourniquet if bleeding is severe, uncontrollable, and life-threatening, and you are trained in its use. Place it high on the limb, between the wound and the heart. Loosen the tourniquet periodically to allow circulation.

6. **Seek Emergency Medical Help:**
   - Call emergency services (911 or the local emergency number) immediately or ask someone else to do so.

7. **Continue Providing Care:**
   - While waiting for medical help, continue to apply pressure to the wound and keep the injured person calm and still.

8. **Do Not Remove Objects from the Wound:**
   - If there are embedded objects in the wound, do not remove them. Apply pressure around the object to control bleeding.

9. **Do Not Elevate the Head for Severe Bleeding:**
   - Avoid elevating the head if the bleeding is severe and the injury involves the head or neck to prevent complications related to potential spinal injuries.

10. **Monitor the Person's Vital Signs:**
   - Continuously monitor the injured person's breathing, pulse, and level of consciousness while waiting for emergency services.

Remember, controlling excessive bleeding is crucial for the injured person's survival. Quick and effective action to stop the bleeding and seeking immediate medical assistance are paramount. However, using tourniquets should be a last resort and should only be applied by someone trained in their proper use, as improper application can lead to complications.
