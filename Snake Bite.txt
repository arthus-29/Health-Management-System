==================> Snake Bite

1. **Stay Calm:**
   - Encourage the victim to remain calm and still to slow down the spread of venom in the body.

2. **Move to Safety:**
   - If possible, move the victim away from the snake to prevent further bites.

3. **Positioning:**
   - Keep the bitten area below the heart level to reduce the spread of venom.

4. **Remove Jewelry or Tight Clothing:**
   - Remove any jewelry or tight clothing near the bite area to reduce constriction if swelling occurs.

5. **Do Not:**
   - Do not attempt to suck out the venom or use a tourniquet.
   - Do not make incisions on the bite area or apply ice.

6. **Clean the Bite Area:**
   - Gently clean the wound with soap and water if available.

7. **Bandage the Bite:**
   - Use a clean, sterile bandage to cover the bite area lightly. Create a loose wrap to slightly compress the area without cutting off blood flow.

8. **Seek Medical Help Immediately:**
   - Call emergency services or take the victim to the nearest medical facility promptly.
   - Provide details about the snake if possible (color, size, shape) but do not put yourself at risk to identify the snake.

9. **Monitor Vital Signs:**
   - While waiting for medical help, monitor the victim's vital signs (pulse, breathing, consciousness) and be prepared to perform CPR if necessary.

10. **Note Time of Bite:**
   - Remember or note the time of the snakebite. This information can be crucial for medical professionals.

It's crucial to get professional medical treatment as soon as possible after a snakebite, as the severity of symptoms can vary depending on the type of snake and the amount of venom injected. Antivenom treatment, if necessary, can only be administered in a medical facility.

Remember, prevention is key. Avoiding snakes and knowing how to safely handle encounters with them can significantly reduce the risk of snakebites. If in an area where venomous snakes are common, wear protective clothing and footwear, and be cautious when walking in tall grass or near bushes and rocks.
