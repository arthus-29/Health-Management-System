================> Electric Shock

1. **Safety First:**
   - Ensure your safety and the safety of others by ensuring the power source is turned off before approaching the victim. Use a non-conductive object (such as a wooden stick) to turn off the power if necessary.

2. **Do Not Touch the Victim Directly:**
   - If the victim is still in contact with the electrical source, do not touch them directly. Use a non-conductive object or material (rubber, wood, or plastic) to separate the person from the electrical source.

3. **Check for Responsiveness:**
   - Assess the victim's responsiveness. If they are not responsive, check their pulse and breathing. If necessary, start CPR immediately.

4. **Call for Emergency Medical Assistance:**
   - Call emergency services (911 or the local emergency number) immediately, especially if the person has severe burns, loss of consciousness, or difficulty breathing.

5. **Care for Burns:**
   - If the victim has burns, do not remove any clothing stuck to the burns. Cover the burnt area with a sterile, non-adhesive dressing or a clean cloth.
   - Do not apply any ointments or creams to the burns.

6. **Keep the Victim Comfortable:**
   - Keep the victim lying down and warm. Elevate their legs slightly unless they have head, neck, back, or leg injuries.

7. **Monitor Vital Signs:**
   - Continuously monitor the victim's vital signs (pulse, breathing, consciousness) while waiting for emergency services to arrive. Be prepared to perform CPR if necessary.

8. **Do Not:**
   - Avoid moving the victim unless they are in immediate danger from the electrical source or other hazards.
   - Do not attempt to treat severe burns yourself.

9. **Provide Reassurance:**
   - Reassure the victim and keep them calm while waiting for medical help.

10. **Prevent Future Incidents:**
   - After the situation is under control, take steps to prevent future incidents by ensuring electrical safety measures are in place, such as covering exposed wires, fixing faulty outlets, and using appropriate safety equipment.

Remember, electrical shock can cause serious injuries, including burns, cardiac arrest, and neurological damage. Professional medical evaluation and treatment are crucial even for seemingly minor electric shocks to assess and manage potential internal injuries or complications.
